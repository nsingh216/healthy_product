# healthy_product


## Text Information Systems Project Overview
The idea behind this project is to cluster different food products based on the associated nutritional components. I used a dataset from Kaggle provided by the Open Food Facts Organization. This dataset contains a variety of attributes about over 600k food products from over 150 countries, such as names, brands, manufacturer, nutritional information, product source, availibity, etc. For the purposes of my project, I decided to focus my analysis on products available in the United States and on the nutritional components (preprocessing function in healthyIngredients.py)

Once I had extracted the data that I wanted to use, I thought about how I wanted to categorize the products. Since this dataset did not have labels, I needed to choose an unsupervised learning technique, such as clustering. I decided to use Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) from the scikit-learn library in Python after reading the Comparision of Clustering Methods paper cited below. This paper noted that GMM enables clusters of varying volumes, unlike other popular techniques such as K-Means. To identify the number of clusters that I should use, I used the silhouette score, also available in scikit-learn.
